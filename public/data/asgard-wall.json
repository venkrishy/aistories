He carried tools, but his hands looked too strong for a hammer. \"All-Father Odin,\" Berg boomed, \"I will build you a wall so mighty that no giant or monster can ever breach it.\""

      "text": "The gods whispered frantically. \"Eight days? Impossible!\" said Thor. \"He's mad!\" Odin thought of how slow mortals were. This was an easy bet. \"Agreed,\" Odin declared, \"but if even one stone is missing after the sun sets on the eighth day, you get nothing.\" Berg merely nodded and whistled for his helper."

      "text": "Sailfari completely forgot the wall, the stones, and the mason. He chased the lovely mare deep into the misty woods. Berg roared in fury and tried to finish the wall himself, struggling with stones too large for one man to move. The sun began to set on the final day."

Berg threw down his tools, his disguise melting away to reveal his true form: a colossal Frost Giant! Before the giant could reach Asgard, a massive hammer struck him down."

      "text": "Weeks later, Loki returned, not as a god, but as a mother. She led a beautiful, silver-grey foal. The foal had eight legs, allowing him to run faster than the wind and carry the All-Father. Loki named him Sleipnir, the greatest horse in all the realms, and a most vital resource acquired for the protection of Asgard."
