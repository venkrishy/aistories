The Quiet Clockwork
When fear collapses... the Seer stands alone
Deep within the cosmic workshop, there is a mechanism of perception. Its gears never cease turning, creating the entire universe we experience. Yet, sometimes, the noise gets too loud.  This mechanism is the Chitta Vrittis—the mind machine. Every thought, every feeling, every memory is a rotation of its intricate gears.
But even the finest machine collects grime. The five afflictions, or Kleśas, are the dust that settle and stick. 
The first and deepest is Avidyā—Ignorance—the grime that makes the machine misread its own blueprints.  Avidyā tricks the mind into believing the temporary is permanent and the impure is pure. 
From this primary ignorance springs the Ego or Asmitā. It grabs the controls and declares, "I am the one turning the gears!".  When the Ego takes charge, the machine generates automatic reactions: Rāga (Attachment) pulls the levers toward pleasant sensations, while Dveṣa (Aversion) slams the brakes on anything unpleasant. They are powerful pendulums swinging uncontrollably.
Every swing, every reaction, leaves a residue. These are Saṁskāras—impressions like seeds buried deep in the machinery’s foundation. They sprout the moment they get enough emotional water, ensuring the machine repeats its patterns.
To clean this cosmic mechanism, Viveka consults the ancient maintenance manual: Ashtanga Yoga, the Eight Limbs. She starts with the ethical guidelines (Yama and Niyama) and physical calibration (Āsana and Prāṇāyāma). These are the cleaning cloths and solvents.
As the external noise softens, she moves inward. Pratyāhāra (Sense Withdrawal) is disconnecting the sensors. Dhāraṇā (Concentration) is focusing on a single gear. Dhyāna (Meditation) is maintaining that steady focus until the mind machine loses its inertia.
Abhiniveśa (Clinging to Life/Fear), the last Kleśa, is finally starved when all the Saṁskāras burn out. Avidyā (Ignorance) is erased as the machine slows to a perfect halt in Samādhi. When the mechanism stops reacting, the true purpose of the Seer is revealed.
When ignorance ends, fear collapses. When fear collapses, attachment dissolves. When attachment dissolves, reactions stop. When reactions stop, the mind quiets. When the mind quiets, the Seer stands alone.
