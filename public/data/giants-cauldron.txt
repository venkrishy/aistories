The Giant's Cauldron
The great sea-god Aegir was preparing a magnificent feast for all the Aesir gods, but his hall lacked one vital thing: a cauldron grand enough to brew mead for every guest. Thor, mighty wielder of Mjöllnir, volunteered for the quest. His companion would be Tyr, the brave god of war, who knew the winding path to the giants' land.
They journeyed far into Jotenheim, the land of ice and stone. When they finally found the house of the fierce Giant, Hymir, it stood cold and dark by a barren coast. Hymir’s wife, whose name was Hróðr, opened the heavy door. She led them inside but warned them: “Hide quickly behind the cooking pots, until I tell my husband you are here. His temper shatters stone.”
Soon, Hymir lumbered in, huge and terrible, with icicles clinging to his beard and eyebrows. Hróðr told him of their visitors. The giant roared, turning his fiery gaze toward the hiding spot. The great wooden beam holding the pots CRACKED and split! Every vessel crashed to the floor.
“Nobody from Asgard is welcome!” Hymir bellowed. “But since you are here, I will treat you as my guests.” He ordered his servants to roast three massive oxen for supper. Thor, who had not eaten since leaving Asgard, was ravenous. He ate all three oxen himself, leaving nothing but bones.
“If you stay here, tomorrow we will eat what I catch,” Hymir frowned the next morning. Thor agreed to go fishing, but when Hymir said he was too small for the great boat, Thor scoffed. The giant demanded bait. Thor walked out and killed the largest, finest ox remaining in Hymir’s herd.
They pushed the boat into the icy sea. Hymir rowed to his usual spot to catch whales, but Thor seized the oars and rowed far beyond, until the giant protested in fear. Thor dropped his huge line, baited with the giant ox-head, deep into the ocean abyss.
Suddenly, the line pulled taut with impossible force! Thor gritted his teeth and hauled, his knuckles white against the rope. A monstrous head erupted from the sea, thrashing and terrifying: Jörmungandr, the Midgard Serpent, whose coils circled the whole world!
Hymir, terrified of the beast that circled the world, grabbed his knife and slashed the fishing line in two! The Serpent sank back beneath the waves, saved by the giant's panic. Thor roared in anger, but in the silence that followed, they rowed back to shore without speaking a single word.
That night, Hymir challenged Thor: “You have proved you can fish, but I call no man strong who cannot break my goblet.” Thor slammed the cup against the table, then a pillar, then the floor. It would not shatter. Hróðr, Hymir’s wife, quietly leaned in and whispered the secret: “The only thing harder than the goblet is Hymir’s own head.”
With a mighty shout, Thor raised the goblet and smashed it against the giant’s thick, bony head! KRA-POW! The goblet exploded into a thousand glittering pieces. Hymir rubbed his bruised scalp but had to admit defeat. “Take any gift you wish,” he mumbled. Thor pointed to the huge cauldron used for brewing mead.
“I want that great pot,” Thor declared. Hymir smiled, certain the gods could never lift it. But Thor simply grabbed the heavy rim, heaved the colossal cauldron onto his shoulders, and walked right out of the hall. It was the largest brewing vessel in all the Nine Realms.
Hymir could only stare in astonishment. With the giant pot securely strapped, Thor and Tyr set off, marching back across the frozen plains of Jotenheim and toward the glorious halls of Asgard, their quest complete. The feast of Aegir was saved!
