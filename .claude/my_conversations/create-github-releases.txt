In github, every time I push to remote, generate release notes.
1. Release frequency (every push to main). 
2. Release notes format: Conventional Commits. 
3.  Release notes added to existing GitHub Releases.  No images/audio changes, just features and 
fixes

  1. Generate Release Notes - Uses git-cliff to create markdown with only features and fixes
  2. Create GitHub Release - Uses GitHub CLI (gh) with a timestamp-based tag like 2025.12.17.143022

  Key changes:
  - Removed the problematic anothrNick/github-tag-version action
  - Uses gh release create which is built-in to GitHub Actions (no external dependency)
  - Tags are timestamped (YYYY.MM.DD.HHMMSS) so each deployment gets a unique release
  - Release notes show only feat and fix commits as configured in cliff.toml

  This is more reliable and will work on your next push to main!
