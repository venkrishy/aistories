Is the story-page-0 element referring to the section that contains story-text?  In that case, rename it to
story-page-text-block.  Next, please switch the story-page-text-block with story-page-image element, with image showing
up on the left first, and text appearing on the right next.  The floating next and previous buttons will now show up on
the text-block instead of the image block.  Similarly, the Listen button will appear on the Text block.  Don't update
any test files, until I have finished my manual testing. @src/components/StoryBook.tsx @src/components/StoryGrid.tsx

Changes Made to StoryBook.tsx, StoryGrid.tsx, LandingPage.tsx and StoryReaderPage.tsx

Changes Made to StoryBook.tsx

  1. Renamed Text Block ID

  - Changed story-page-${currentPage} → story-page-text-block-${currentPage}
  - Now clearly identifies the text content section

  2. Swapped Layout

  - Left side (was text): Now displays IMAGE (story-page-image-block-${currentPage})
  - Right side (was image): Now displays TEXT (story-page-text-block-${currentPage})
  - Updated border styling from border-r-2 to border-l-2 on text block

  3. Repositioned Listen Button

  - Moved from top-left spanning full width → top-right over text block
  - Uses md:w-1/2 to position only on the text half on medium screens
  - Aligned right with justify-end

  4. Repositioned Navigation Buttons

  - Moved from bottom spanning full width → bottom-right over text block
  - Uses md:w-1/2 to position only on the text half on medium screens
  - Previous and Next buttons now appear on the text block

  5. Updated Animation Directions

  - Image initial rotation: -90 (slides in from left)
  - Text initial rotation: +90 (slides in from right)
  - Ensures smooth 3D book-flip effect with new layout

  The layout now follows a image-left, text-right format with all interactive controls (Listen button and navigation) positioned over the text block. Ready for your manual testing!
