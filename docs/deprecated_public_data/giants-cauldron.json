Thor, mighty wielder of Mjöllnir, volunteered for the quest. His companion would be Tyr, the brave god of war, who knew the winding path to the giants' land."

Hymir's wife, whose name was Hróðr, opened the heavy door. She led them inside but warned them: \"Hide quickly behind the cooking pots, until I tell my husband you are here. His temper shatters stone.\""

The giant roared, turning his fiery gaze toward the hiding spot. The great wooden beam holding the pots CRACKED and split! Every vessel crashed to the floor."

Thor, who had not eaten since leaving Asgard, was ravenous. He ate all three oxen himself, leaving nothing but bones."

Thor agreed to go fishing, but when Hymir said he was too small for the great boat, Thor scoffed. The giant demanded bait. Thor walked out and killed the largest, finest ox remaining in Hymir's herd."

Thor roared in anger, but in the silence that followed, they rowed back to shore without speaking a single word."

It would not shatter. Hróðr, Hymir's wife, quietly leaned in and whispered the secret: \"The only thing harder than the goblet is Hymir's own head.\""
