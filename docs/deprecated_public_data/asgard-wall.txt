The Building of Asgard's Wall
The glorious home of the gods, Asgard, sat unprotected. One blustery morning, a huge, silent man named Berg approached the golden gates. He carried tools, but his hands looked too strong for a hammer. "All-Father Odin," Berg boomed, "I will build you a wall so mighty that no giant or monster can ever breach it."
Odin, surrounded by his powerful gods, raised an eyebrow. "And what is your price, strange mason?" Berg smiled, a terrible flash of teeth. "I ask for the beautiful Goddess Freya, the
shimmering Sun, and the silver Moon.
And I must finish the wall in just eight days."
The gods whispered frantically. "Eight days? Impossible!" said Thor. "He's mad!" Odin thought of how slow mortals were. This was an easy bet.
"Agreed," Odin declared, "but if even one stone is missing after the sun sets on the eighth day, you get nothing." Berg merely nodded and whistled for his helper.
Out of the cold fog lumbered a mighty, grey stallion named Svailfari.
Svailfari was the strongest horse in all the nine realms. Berg didn't lift the colossal stones; Svailfari dragged them from the mountain quarry faster than eagles could fly, never seeming to tire.
By the sixth day, the impossible was happening. The wall towered higher than the clouds. Berg worked tirelessly, but it was Svailfari who never stopped, fetching stone after stone, day and night. The gods stared in horror as their prizes slipped away.
"Loki!" Odin thundered. "This is your fault for letting me make the bet! You must stop this mason!" Loki smiled, licking his lips. "A tricky problem requires a tricky solution, All-Father."
Loki snuck away from Asgard's towering wall.
Loki transformed into the most beautiful mare Svailfari had ever seen.
She had a shimmering coat and a mane like flowing silk. She trotted right up to the working stallion and gave a soft, inviting whinny before trotting away.
Sailfari completely forgot the wall, the stones, and the mason. He chased the lovely mare deep into the misty woods. Berg roared in fury and tried to finish the wall himself, struggling with stones too large for one man to move.
The sun began to set on the final day.
The eighth day ended. The wall was magnificent, but one small stone was missing near the top. "You failed!" cried Odin. Berg threw down his tools, his disguise melting away to reveal his true form: a colossal Frost Giant! Before the giant could reach Asgard, a massive hammer struck him down.
Weeks later, Loki returned, not as a god, but as a mother. She led a beautiful, silver-grey foal. The foal had eight legs, allowing him to run faster than the wind and carry the All-Father.
Loki named him Sleipnir, the greatest horse in all the realms, and a most vital resource acquired for the protection of Asgard.
